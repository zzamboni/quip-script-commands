### The section names are arbitrary, and you should define at least the FolderID
### attribute for each of them (but it's not mandatory)
### The document/folder IDs can be obtained by using the "Copy Link" menu
### option in Quip. The ID is the part that comes right after the hostname
### in the URL. For example: https://quip.com/A7RmAB1oNeuL
